Calculator
==========

Simple web-based calculator

Test by cloning the repository and (on a Mac at least) running the following command:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Things remaining to do:
- Implement decimal key
- Improve layout of numeric display
- Improve placement of current operation legend
- Handle attempts to divide by zero
- Add error message output (for sqrt of negative numbers, division by zero error or trying to enter numbers that are too long)
- Learn whether Polymer makes it easy for me to refactor the calculator out into a separate self-contained object
